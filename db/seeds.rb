project1_step1 = Step.create!(title: "Jointed crankbaits (aka âbroke-back crankbaitsâ) add a whole new dimension to lure fishing. If you take one of your favorite 1-piece crankbaits bodies, cut it in two and then rejoin it, youâll be surprised at the difference", project_id: makingLuresOneOOne.id, body: "On the upside, adding a join somewhere in the lure body causes it to have a more sinuous, slithery actionâ¦â¦ and it does so at much lower cranking speeds. This means you can keep it wiggling enticingly in âthe zoneâ for much longer. They also tend to make a little more noise, which can be either advantageous or not, depending on your circumstances. On the down-side? Their floppiness means that jointed crankbaits tend to cast poorly, both in terms of distance and accuracy. More hardware means more potential places for the lure to break. If youâre using screw eyes, the tail section is particularly vulnerable, so be sure to read my article on how to use screw eyes for maximum strength. Of course, more hardware also means more potential entry points for water. And jointed crankbaits are a little more fiddly and time consuming to make than single piece bodies. 3 Tips For Designing And Making Jointed Crankbaits âVâ Cut Vs Straight Cut I usually shape the bodies of my jointed crankbaits as a single piece and then cut them in two for rejoining them. When I get to the cutting stage, there are two options: A straight cut that leaves both ends square, or A âVâ joint made by angling the saw back towards the tail and cutting half way through from each side of the lure. A âVâ cut is a bit more work and takes a little more skill to get right. But it has the advantage of concealing the joint more when the lure is looked at from the side. On the other hand, a straight cut is fast and easy, but leaves a big open gap in the lure when looked at from side on. Which is best? I still prefer the appearance of jointed crankbaits that use a âVâ cut. But experience and observations suggest the fish donât really care either way.")
project1_step2 = Step.create!(title: "Screw Eyes", project_id: makingLuresOneOOne.id, body: "Jointed crankbaits are usually held together by interconnecting screw eyes or hand made through wires that interlock. One of the advantages of screw eyes (and the reason I always use a screw eye for prototypes) is that you can adjust the gap between the two body parts. Just open the screw eyes up, separate the two parts and screw the eyes in or out further. Then put the lure back together and re-test it. Once I know what gaps works best I can make through wires for future lures. The reason this is important is that the two halves of the lure body limit the movement, as show in the image. As a rule with jointed crankbaits, the wider the gap between the body parts, the wider the action of the lure and the better it can be worked at slower speeds. On the flip side, a narrower gap gives a tighter action, but a more stable lure that can handle a wider range of speeds.")
project1_step2 = Step.create!(title: "Single Or Double Jointed?", project_id: makingLuresOneOOne.id, body: "Jointed crankbaits can be constructed with a single joint â 1 loop on the front connecting to two loops on the tail. Or they can have double joints: two loops on each of the parts, one above the other. Single joints tend to be more floppy and give a more erratic, wider action. The tail section also tends to hang down into the water when they are at rest, which presents the rear hook nicely to the fish. They can usually be worked more slowly, too. A Double Hinged Jointed CrankbaitDouble joints restrict the movement of the tail section to just side to side and pretty much eliminate up and down movement. This helps with casting and stabilizes the lure so it can be worked a little faster. In my view it also looks more natural when the lure is swimming. The Wash-up On Jointed Crankbaits Like any style of lure, jointed crankbaits have their pros and cons. They have their fans and their haters too! To be honest, when Iâm fishing this is not a style of lure I often search my lure selection for. But on their day, jointed crankbaits can definitely out-fish other styles. So if youâre having a quiet day on the water and want to give fish something different, give them a go!")

project5_step1 = Step.create!(title: "Intro to Lure Making", project_id: makingLures5.id, body: "Well, here it is! The Lure Making Web Site many of you have waited many years for. I am sure you are much like I am. Whenever I sit at my work tackle work bench and begin making a few lures my mind begins to drift off into nowhere land. I begin thinking of fishing trips, and I even recollect the many individual fish I have taken in the past and dream of trips, excursions and fish that I hope and dream will taken in the future. This is an updated version of our first lure making web site. I have added many create! illustrations and photos and many more details. The instructions to making more lures and many more tips which I hope will make your tackle making life more enjoyable. Instructions to create! and exciting lures will be added over time as time permits. What you will see and read here is information gathered from my years of designing and making lures and from many of you who have been making and selling tackle for years. I would like to take this opportunity to thank many of the tackle manufactures and fishing guides who I am in contact with on a regular basis and do not hesitate to share valuable information on the making of fishing tackle. I hope you find the Lure Maker's Work Shop easy to follow, practical and most of all I hope it gets you started in what I believe is an incredibly fun hobby or possibly even a business. This manual has been written with the simple goal of introducing anglers to the world of lure making in a concise and practical manner. As a partner in Real Pro's SportFishing I am lucky to speak with thousands of anglers across Canada and the United States and now the world each year, many of whom said they wanted a simple guide to making the most practical lures. Please remember that not every lure you assemble, design from scratch, or copy from a brand name lure will work perfectly without a little tinkering or redesigning. It would be great if they all worked on our first attempt. Don't get discouraged if a few, or even most of them don't work out as planned. Be prepared to take a few apart and rebuild them from scratch. It's part of the fun. But in no time at all you too will be building a wide variety of incredible fish catching lures.")

project8_step3 = Step.create!(title: "Solution:", project_id: makingLures8.id, body: "Unfortunately it has some fatal flaws, but can be resolved when you make your own for less than 50 cents each.  First flaw is that the top hook gets no action at all, its just too far out of the strike zone.  The 2nd flaw is that the hooks are just too close together.  When you hook up with a fish, you will get another hook into the meat along its backside at some point. The solution is easy, tie on your snap at the bottom, within the first two inches run the line (typically 20 or 25 lb test) twice through a 5 mm bead and slide on your #6 gold perch hook, then run another 5 mm bead down the line and loop the line through once.")
project8_step4 = Step.create!(title: "Rinse And Repeat", project_id: makingLures8.id, body: "Repeat this process 8 to 10 inches above the first hook, and then 20 inches or so above that, tie on a crane swivel.  If you are already using a snap and swivel on your main line, you can skip the crane swivel, and just tie a double loop knot to connect too.  Now, to get your third hook on the line, down at the snap, attach an eight inch snell when you put your weight on.  You will catch more fish simply because you have now three hooks in the perchâs natural strike zoneâ¦.easy peasy!")




project9_step1 = Step.create!(title: "Jigs", project_id: makingLures9.id, body: "Of all lures, I would say that jigs are the most versatile. A jig can catch about every game fish there is, and are inexpensive to boot. They have a weighted lead head and come in every size and color and can be âdressedâ (think of it like a tail or skirt) in feathers, hair, a soft plastic grub, or with the bait of your choice. Jig fishing takes a lot of concentration, unlike spinners, all the âactionâ (how a lure moves in the water) comes from you. If you donât do anything the jig just sinks. The classic way to fish a jig is to cast it out, wait until it hits the bottom (you will know it has hit bottom when your line goes slack), then retrieve it in a series of hops. You make it hop by lifting the rod tip, lowering it, and retrieving your line. Try different speeds, big lifts, little hops, twitching until you find what works. Pay attention, though. Detecting the strike is the hardest thing about jigging.")
project9_step2 = Step.create!(title: "Spinner", project_id: makingLures9.id, body: "Spinners are a great beginner lure because they are so easy to use. They are essentially a metal shaft with spinning blade. The hook can be bare or dressed. Dragging a spinner through water causes the blade to spin. The spinning motion of the blade creates sound and vibration that can be picked up by fish through their lateral line (youâll learn more about this in the fish section.) This makes spinners an excellent choice for stained or murky water. Simple as can be. Cast and retrieve, thatâs it. As long as the blade is spinning, its working. You can try speeding up or slowing down your retrieve for variety.")
project9_step3 = Step.create!(title: "Spoons", project_id: makingLures9.id, body: "Spoons are curved metal lures. The first spoons were just that, spoons with the handle broken off. Today, spoons can be had (like all other lures) in any color and size. There is a spoon for every fishing situation. The shape of this lure gives it its distinctive action. Spoons move through water with a side-to-side wobble that simulates an injured baitfish, and game fish just love injured baitfish. Some spoons are made to be cast, others to be trolled, and some even to be jigged. As a beginner you will most likely be using the most common type; the casting spoon. Casting spoons are easy to use. Like spinners, just cast and retrieve. You can vary your speed as long as itâs wobbling. If the spoon begins to spin, slow down your retrieve. Add a split ring to the eye of the lure for better action.")
project9_step4 = Step.create!(title: "Soft Plastic", project_id: makingLures9.id, body: "Soft plastic baits encompass a variety of different lures, mostly used for bass fishing. The classic soft plastic bait is the worm. These type of baits are created by pouring liquid plastic into a mould and adding dyes, metallic flakes, or even scent. They can resemble the natural forage of fish, like worms, crawfish, lizards or frogs, but some plastic baits donât resemble anything you might find in or out of the water; these are referred to as creature baits or âcritters.â The soft plastic bodies of these lures, encourage fish to hold on to them a little longer before they spit them out, giving the angler a better chance to set the hook. Presentation for soft plastic baits depends on the type of bait. For the classic worm, the most popular technique is the Texas Rig. To rig your worm this way, you use a bullet weight (read the section on sinkers in the terminal tackle post if you donât know what a bullet weight is). Thread the bullet weight on the the line above your hook, and then insert the hook through the top of the wormâs head, then bury the barb into the body of the worm to make it âweedlessâ (meaning it will not get hung up on underwater foliage.) Now cast it into a likely fish holding area and let it fall to the bottom. Twitch your rod tip a few times. If you still donât have a bite, hop it back to you in short twitchy hops.")
project9_step5 = Step.create!(title: "Plug", project_id: makingLures9.id, body: "Plugs are constructed from hollow plastic or wood to resemble baitfish, frogs or other prey. They usually sport two or three treble hooks. These hard bodied lures can be fished at almost any depth, as some are made to float or dive or both. Depending on the design, a plug will wobble, rattle or gurgle. They come in all sizes, and most of them have some sort of plastic lip that allows them to dive when you pull them through the water. Different kind of plugs include: crankbaits, jerkbaits, surface plugs, floating/diving plugs, and poppers, One of the most effective (and one of the first plugs you should add to your tackle box) is the long, narrow minnow imitation in three to four inch length, the original is made by Rapala. It floats when its not moving and dives shallowly when itâs retrieved. Add a split ring to the eye if it doesnât have one. Cast it out and wait until the rings on the surface of the water dissipate, then retrieve it slowly or fast, stopping suddenly and maybe throwing in an occasional twitch.")

Add weight to the book, such as more books, until you get the tension you like and begin winding.But it helps to have a cradle to hold the rod while you wind the thread onto the guides.

makingPoles3_step1 = Step.create!(title: "MONOFILAMENT", body: "Let me say right up front that I no longer flip or pitch with mono. There are better choices, and I use them. Still, it's not like I haven't caught my share of bass with it. In fact, it's all I used for many years.The first problem with monofilament fishing line is that its abrasion resistance isn't all that great. Almost by definition when you're flipping or pitching you're in heavy cover. That'll eat your line up in no time.The second big problem with mono is stretch. It can be very difficult to get a good hook set with it if you have a bad angle to the fish or too much line out. You can reduce the stretch factor by upsizing your line. The difference between 20-pound test and 25-pound test is huge.If you're on a very tight budget, monofilament is still the cheapest way to go. So, if you have to use it make sure you check it every few casts and retie frequently â at least after every fish â and never use less than 25-pound test (30 is even better).", project_id: buildingRods3.id)
makingPoles3_step2 = Step.create!(title: "FLUOROCARBON", body: "I probably use fluorocarbon line 80 percent of the time. It has reasonably good abrasion resistance, almost no stretch and is nearly invisible.The lightest weight I use is 20-pound test, and I only fish with that under very controlled circumstances. If I'm flipping or pitching to isolated cover in very clear water I'll go with it, but it scares me even then. The risk of a break-off is just too great. I'm willing to take that risk, however, if I think it'll get me more quality bites.Most days I'm going to spool 25-pound test. It isn't that much harder to handle, and it gives me an extra margin of error. It removes the fear factor when I'm competing.", project_id: buildingRods3.id)
makingPoles3_step3 = Step.create!(title: "BRAID", body: "Braid is really the best line for flipping and pitching. It doesn't break and it has no stretch. Unfortunately, it's highly visible, and that can be a big drawback in clear water. I always use it when conditions permit, however. Mostly that's when I'm penetrating heavy mats or fishing stained water.Fishing heavy mats is tough on your line. First, there's the abrasion factor. The heavy, snarled vegetation â some of it years old with a surface like sandpaper â can cut line in an instant. Braid will fray or cut; it's not perfect. But it won't do so nearly as quickly as monofilament or fluorocarbon.Next is the hook set factor. When you flip or pitch into a heavy mat you're dropping your bait down through it towards the bottom of the lake. If you look at what's happening, you'll note that the line runs from your rod tip straight to the mat and then goes straight down. It makes a 90-degree angle at the mat.", project_id: buildingRods3.id)

But until recently, I've never actually tried building one myself. And now that I know how simple it is, I regret not having done it sooner.I know what you're thinking â with so many rods out there to choose from, why build one yourself? Actually, there are several reasons. Building your own rod can be fun and rewarding, and, even better, it gives you the opportunity to build it to your own specifications.", project_id: buildingRods4.id)
makingPoles4_step2 = Step.create!(title: "Getting Started", body: "Let's assume you know what type of rod it is you intend to build, and you already have a blank picked out â its material type, length and action, all ready to go. The next step is to pick the right guides, reel seat, and handle components so that the rod suits your specific needs. And believe it or not, much of that is decided by the brand and model reel you plan to pair to the rod when it's complete. To make the selection process easier for spinning rods, Anglers Resource developed a computerized program to help you make those choices. It's called Guide Placement Software (GPS) and it's super quick and easy. It's also free. I recommend looking there.", project_id: buildingRods4.id)

makingPoles5_step1 = Step.create!(title: "STEP 1: HANDLE ASSEMBLY", body: "To begin the build, you must first test-fit the handle components to the blank you've selected. This will include the reel seat, foregrip, rear grip and/or butt grip, butt cap, the arbors (that occupy the space between the reel seat and the blank) and the winding checks (the small decorative washers that cover and protect any exposed cork ends wherever they occur). The interior sections of each cork piece will need to be reamed with a rattail file, as will the arbors inside the reel seat. Remove only a necessary amount of material so that each piece fits snugly to the blank in its appropriate position. With all pieces in place, itâs time to glue up the handle, reels seat and winding checks using rod epoxy. Mark the blank with a white grease pencil so you'll know where to reposition each component. For visual help on this phase, follow this link.", project_id: buildingRods5.id)
makingPoles5_step2 = Step.create!(title: "STEP 2: GUIDE PLACEMENT", body: "With the reel seat and grips secured to the blank, it's time to align the guide train (all of the guides) with the reel.

For spinning rods, you're ready to apply the proprietary Guide Placement Software (GPS). Enter the required measurements of your reel into the proper boxes.

This is a critical aspect of your project, since it is the final phase of setting up your rod prior to wrapping.Tape the guides (regular masking tape works well) in place according to the type rod you're building and the style guide you selected. Mount the reel and use a practice plug to determine the overall performance of the rod. It should be quiet, smooth, and exhibit zero âline slapâ against the blank. If necessary, move guides slightly to achieve optimum performance.  ", project_id: buildingRods5.id)

makingPoles6_step1 = Step.create!(title: "How dedicated are you?", body: "I've shortened the butts on many of my rods...the way I fish and the size of my hands, I don't need those long butts, and in my opinion, if the rod is of good quality and light weight, the so-called balance that the butts are supposed to provide is highly overrated. And long butts get in the way when I'm manipulating a topwater lure. I often don't even bother to plug up the end of the rod butt once I hacksaw it off. Might look a little trashy and unfinished, but it doesn't affect the use of the rod that I can see.", project_id: buildingRods6.id)
makingPoles6_step2 = Step.create!(title: "Adding New Butt(if you wish)", body: "When it comes to choosing butt-cap styles, Fogle notes that gimbaled caps, which lock into a holder, might be necessary for trollers and those who fight large pelagics. Do not, however, try to brace a gimbaled butt cap against your gut without a fighting belt or a slide-on butt cap unless you enjoy being bruised and scraped. Fogle also says that long-butt offshore boat rods (intended strictly for use in a fighting chair) have become far less popular than stand-up gear in the past few years, although he has recently built rods for some customers with Winthrop rod butts that adjust between straight and bent, and can be multipurposed.", project_id: buildingRods6.id)
makingPoles6_step3 = Step.create!(title: "Finishin Up", body: "So at least for the time being, aluminum will be reserved for the heaviest applications, while casting and inshore rods will remain limited to cork, EVA, Hypalon, rubber and plastic. And this fits a familiar pattern: As is true of most fishing gear, every choice reflects a trade-off. A rod used purely for casting light lures in inshore waters will be best off with a light butt and a plastic cap, just as long as you realize that plastic wonât last forever. You can improve longevity with rubber, but weight will also go up. A rod used for heavier action will benefit from the added leverage of a longer butt, but youâll pay for that leverage when the butt gets caught in your shirt or jacket as you try to cast.Each seemingly small choice you make when selecting a rod butt has an effect on different aspects of how you use that rod. And while the tiptop might get most of the attention, that butt end plays a significant role in just how satisfied you will ultimately be with each and every fishing rod in your rack.", project_id: buildingRods6.id)
